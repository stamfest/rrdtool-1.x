=head1 NAME

rrdmodify - Change the data source structure of an RRD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> {B<modify>} I<in-filename> I<out-filename> 
S<[ B<DEL:>I<ds-name> | B<DS:>I<ds-spec> ... ]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<modify> function copies an RRD file I<in-filename> to
I<out-filename>, possible removing or adding data sources on the
fly. When I<in-filename> and I<out-filename> denote the same file,
this is (almost) identical to an in-place modification.

=over 8

=item I<in-filename>

The name of the source B<RRD> file you want to copy/modify.

=item I<out-filename>

The name of the destination B<RRD> file. If it names the same file as
I<in-filename>, the new RRD will effectively relace the old one.

=item B<DEL:>I<ds-name>

Every data source named with a DEL specification will be removed
during the copy operation. The resulting RRD will miss both the
definition and the data for that data source. Multiple DEL
specifications are permitted.


=item B<DS:>I<ds-spec>

For every such data source definition (for the exact syntax see the
create command), a new data source will be added to the output
RRD. Multiple DS specifications are permitted.

=item B<--daemon> I<address>

If given, B<RRDTool> will try to connect to the caching daemon
L<rrdcached> at I<address> and will fail if the connection cannot be
established. If the connection is successfully established the data
for the I<in-filename> will be flushed before performing the
copy/modify operation. Afterwards the I<out-filename> will be
forgotten by the cache daemon, so that the next access using the
caching daemon will read the proper structure.

For a list of accepted formats, see the B<-l> option in the L<rrdcached> manual.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables may be used to change the behavior of
C<rrdtoolE<nbsp>update>:

=over

=item B<RRDCACHED_ADDRESS>

If this environment variable is set it will have the same effect as specifying
the C<--daemon> option on the command line. If both are present, the command
line argument takes precedence.
